# PyVideoConverter
A short script that will allow you to convert your video files with python using ffmpeg!


How to use:
Download ffmpeg from their website: ffmpeg.org and drop it in the same folder as your python file.

Now you are good to go!  As far as I know this only works with windows currently.
It uses the default ffmpeg settings, which can be changed simply by editing the converter_file_string
